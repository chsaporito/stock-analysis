# Refactoring stock-analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to refactor vba code so that it will run faster, improve performance and improve the user experience. Improved performance will be important as the dataset grows. To determine if there was an increase in performance, metrics will be taken for completion time.
### Results
After refacoring the code to run the stock analysis, there was a signifivcant improvement in performance. Comparing running the old code with the running of the refactored code we can see a reduction of the time that it takes from execution to getting the results. The orinal code took about a second to run which doesn't seem bad.
